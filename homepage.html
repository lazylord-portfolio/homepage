            <h1>A page by Kim-Kristian Seppala</h1>
            <p>This site contains multiple certifications for recruiters
                as well as a log of completed and ongoing projects.
                The site itself is meant to act as a demonstration of my
                skills in web-development and design. The full
                implementation was done by hand and so, I invite any
                interested parties to freely inpect it further. On this
                site there are also segments where one can view
                feedback from previous emplyers and peers as well as
                leave further feedback for me.
